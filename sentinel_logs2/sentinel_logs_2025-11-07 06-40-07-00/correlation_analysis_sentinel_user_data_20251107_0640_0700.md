## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)**

We detected unusual activity where our guest user, Lalit Paliwal, experienced a critical authentication failure while trying to access our systems. This is concerning because it involved a guest attempting cross-tenant access, and their reliance on single-factor authentication makes this type of account a higher security risk.

---

**2. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Palak  Patel (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Palak Patel, successfully accessed one of our applications from an external tenant. This is concerning because it highlights a potential vulnerability where cross-tenant access occurred using only single-factor authentication, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to our data.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Bhosale  Shrikant Shrirang (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Shrikant Bhosale, successfully accessed one of our applications. This is concerning because it involved cross-tenant access by a guest user, protected only by a single password, which is a less secure method than our standard.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Venkata Sailakshmisoundarya Bharathi Damaraju (1 events)**

We've detected a guest user, Venkata Sailakshmisoundarya Bharathi Damaraju, successfully accessing one of our applications. This activity is concerning because it involved a guest account from another organization using only a single password to gain access, which increases our exposure to potential threats.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Poornima Rathaur (1 events)**

We observed a guest user, Poornima Rathaur, successfully access one of our applications from an external location. This is concerning because the access relied solely on a single password, and guest accounts accessing our systems from outside our usual network significantly increases our risk of unauthorized access if that password were ever compromised.

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Risk Score 7-10



## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Risk Score 5-6


### 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)

**Alert Summary:** Success rate: 50.0%

**📝 Description:** _We've identified unusual activity where Lalit Paliwal, a guest user, experienced a critical authentication failure while attempting to access our systems. This is concerning because it involved a guest user trying to access resources across different parts of our environment, which, combined with the critical failure, could indicate an unauthorized access attempt._

**Risk Factors:** Critical authentication failures: 1, Predominantly single-factor authentication, Guest user cross-tenant access

**Behavioral Anomalies:** Critical authentication failures: 1
