## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Suspicious Rapid Activity - Chandrakant Vishwakarma (1 failures/12 events)**

Chandrakant Vishwakarma triggered multiple activities across different locations and applications with a success rate of 91.67%. This is concerning because there were five activity clusters and six rapid events occurring in just 36 seconds, which could indicate potential misuse or unauthorized access attempts. The high number of events suggests someone might be trying to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access quickly.

---

**2. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Critical Authentication Failures - Aarushi Trivedi (1 failures/1 events)**

Aarushi Trivedi had one event with a risk score of 4 out of 10, indicating there was at least one critical failure in authentication. This means someone might have tried to access systems using incorrect or fake credentials, which is very concerning as it could lead to unauthorized use and compromise of sensitive information.

---

**3. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - 451fa0fb-e092-49d6-8d49-4f0e63f88458 (1 failures/1 events)**

This security incident involves a risk score of 3 out of 10 with one failure event. It highlights issues like using single-factor authentication and allowing guest users to have access across different tenants, which could make the system more vulnerable to unauthorized access. These key issues are concerning because they indicate weak security practices that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized control or data theft.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Swaraj Arvind Sontakke (1 events)**

A security incident occurred where a user with low risk score used guest account to access multiple locations without any failures or issues reported. This is concerning because the system allows users, even those with very low risk scores, to have unrestricted access as a guest, bypassing important multi-factor authentication steps that are usually required for such high-risk actions.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Aarushi  Trivedi (1 events)**

Aarushi Trivedi used a guest account to log in from an unknown location with no multi-factor authentication. This is concerning because it allowed unauthorized access without proper security measures, which could lead to data breaches or misuse of resources.

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Risk Score 7-10



## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Risk Score 5-6


### 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Suspicious Rapid Activity - Chandrakant Vishwakarma (1 failures/12 events)

**Alert Summary:** Success rate: 91.67% | 5 applications | 5 activity sessions

**📝 Description:** _Chandrakant Vishwakarma had multiple suspicious activities detected across different locations and applications with a high success rate of 91.67%. This is concerning because there were five activity clusters and six rapid events occurring within just 36 seconds, indicating potential insider threats or unauthorized access attempts that could compromise security._

**Risk Factors:** Multiple activity clusters: 5, Rapid event cluster: 6 events in 36s

**Behavioral Anomalies:** Multiple distinct activity sessions: 5 clusters
