## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav (2 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav, successfully accessed two of our applications. This is concerning because the access involved crossing into different parts of our system and was only protected by a single password, which increases the risk of unauthorized access if that password were to be compromised.

---

**2. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Rohan Karekar (1 events)**

We detected that a guest user, Rohan Karekar, successfully accessed resources across different parts of our system. This is concerning because guest users should not typically have cross-tenant access, especially when only using a single password for authentication, which increases the risk of unauthorized access.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Manisha Anil Thete (1 events)**

We detected a guest user from another organization successfully accessing one of our applications. The concern is that this access occurred from their company's network and likely only required a single password, which could expose our systems if their account were ever compromised.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Lakhan  Patidar (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Lakhan Patidar, successfully accessed one of our applications. This is concerning because it involved a guest from an external organization accessing our systems, and this access was only protected by a single password, which increases the risk of unauthorized entry.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Prakhar  Vyas (1 events)**

We've detected a successful access event by a guest user, Prakhar Vyas, to one of our applications. This is concerning because the access relied on single-factor authentication and involved cross-tenant access, which are significant security risks that could lead to unauthorized data exposure.
