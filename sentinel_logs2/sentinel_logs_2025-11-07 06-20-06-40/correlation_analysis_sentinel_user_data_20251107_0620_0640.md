## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Critical Authentication Failures - Pooja Gupta (2 failures/2 events)**

We detected two failed attempts by an unknown user, Pooja Gupta, to log into one of our applications, where her account does not exist. These critical login failures from a single location are concerning as they could indicate an unauthorized individual attempting to access our systems.

---

**2. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Prajvi Jain (2 events)**

We've detected that a guest user, Prajvi Jain, successfully accessed two of our applications. This is concerning because it involved accessing resources across different parts of our system, and their access was only protected by a single password, which increases the risk of unauthorized access.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Ishita  Porwal (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Ishita Porwal, successfully accessed an application. This is concerning because guest users accessing different parts of our system, especially when only protected by a single password, could create a security risk.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Yukta Nagle (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Yukta Nagle, successfully accessed an application within our system. This is concerning because guest users accessing resources across different parts of our organization, especially when only protected by a single password, increases our risk of unauthorized access.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Salunke Ajinkya  Bhagwat (1 events)**

We observed a guest user, Salunke Ajinkya Bhagwat, successfully accessing our system from another company's network. This is concerning because they only used a single password to gain access, which makes us more vulnerable to unauthorized access if that password were ever compromised.
