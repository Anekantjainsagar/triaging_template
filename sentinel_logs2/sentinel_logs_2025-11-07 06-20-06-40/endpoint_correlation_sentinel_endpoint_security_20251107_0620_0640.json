      "description": "The device `bastionserver1` is flagged with `IsTransient: true`. Bastion servers are typically persistent, long-lived infrastructure components critical for secure access, not ephemeral or transient. This configuration is highly unusual and could indicate a serious misconfiguration, an unauthorized dynamic deployment of a bastion server, or a potential security bypass where temporary resources might not adhere to the same rigorous security hardening and monitoring standards as persistent infrastructure.",
