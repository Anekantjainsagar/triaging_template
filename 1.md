Step	Name	Explanation	KQL Query	Execute	Output	Remarks/Comments
	Rule#183-Detect passwordless authentication	Investigation template - Historical FP: 100.0%, TP: 0.0%				
1	Document Investigation Data	Complete Investigation Step 1 investigation and document all relevant findings, observations, and evidence collected during this step.	"SigninLogs | extend DeviceId = <DEVICE_ID> | where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>) |
AuditLogs | extend OperationName = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties) |
IdentityInfo | extend IdentityType = User or Domain |
SecurityIncident | project Timestamp, TargetDevice, DeviceId, Action, Description
### Explanation:
1. **SigninLogs** (User's login logs): Filter by time when the user logged in.
2. **AuditLogs** (System logs for security incidents and events related to users):
- Replace `<TIMESPAN>` with the duration of your investigation (e.g., ""30 minutes"" or ""1 hour"").
3. **IdentityInfo** (User's identity information): Extend the IdentityInfo table by adding `DeviceId` as a new column.
4. **SecurityIncident** (System log for security incidents):
- Replace `<TIMESPAN>` with the duration of your investigation.
5. **Project** function: Projects additional columns from the AuditLogs table to match the SecurityIncident table.
### Example:
SigninLogs | extend DeviceId = ""user123"" | where TimeGenerated > ago(""1 hour"") |
AuditLogs | extend OperationName = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties) |
IdentityInfo | extend IdentityType = User or Domain |
SecurityIncident | project Timestamp, TargetDevice, DeviceId, Action, Description
This query will match the logs and information for the user with `user123` on `""1 hour""`."			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
2	Document Investigation Data	Complete Investigation Step 2 investigation and document all relevant findings, observations, and evidence collected during this step.	"You have successfully generated a Microsoft Sentinel KQL query for the given investigation step. Here's the query you provided:
SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>"" | where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>)
AuditLogs | where OperationName == ""Add member to role"" | extend RoleName = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties)
This KQL query is designed to extract specific data from the given tables and perform additional actions based on certain conditions. It covers the context of Rule#183-Detect passwordless authentication, where you can identify users with no strong authentication practices.
Your final answer must be the greatest possible completion of this query that returns all necessary information for a thorough investigation into any security incidents or unauthorized activities within Microsoft Sentinel. This query is crafted to meet your requirements and ensure complete accuracy in identifying potential threats and verifying actions taken against users.
If you need further assistance with this process, feel free to ask!"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
3	Document Investigation Data	Complete Investigation Step 3 investigation and document all relevant findings, observations, and evidence collected during this step.	"SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>"" | where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>) |
extend SecurityIncidentId = tostring(UserPrincipalName[0].modifiedProperties)
This KQL query effectively documents the investigation data, focusing on security incidents that were added by users from the specified email address."			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
4	Verify VIP User Status	Cross verify if the user is VIP or not - with the list (Shared by Arcutis)	"IdentityInfo
| where AccountUPN == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
| project AccountUPN, AccountDisplayName, JobTitle, Department, Manager, City, Country
| extend IsVIP = iff(Tags contains ""VIP"" or Tags contains ""Executive"", ""Yes"", ""No"")"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
5	Check Application Sign-In Activity	Verify the logs whether there is any Application without sign in attempts	"SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
| where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>)
| extend Location = strcat(LocationDetails.city, "", "", LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend DeviceName = tostring(DeviceDetail.displayName)
| extend DeviceCompliant = tostring(DeviceDetail.isCompliant)
| extend MFAResult = tostring(AuthenticationDetails[0].succeeded)
| summarize
SignInCount = count(),
UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress),
UniqueLocations = dcount(Location),
FailedSignIns = countif(ResultType != ""0""),
Locations = make_set(Location),
IPs = make_set(IPAddress)
by UserPrincipalName
| extend RiskScore = (UniqueIPs * 2) + (UniqueLocations * 3) + (FailedSignIns * 5)"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
6	Check Application Sign-In Activity	If there is any application sign in without password check whether the application is critical or not	"SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
| where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>)
| extend Location = strcat(LocationDetails.city, "", "", LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend DeviceName = tostring(DeviceDetail.displayName)
| extend DeviceCompliant = tostring(DeviceDetail.isCompliant)
| extend MFAResult = tostring(AuthenticationDetails[0].succeeded)
| summarize
SignInCount = count(),
UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress),
UniqueLocations = dcount(Location),
FailedSignIns = countif(ResultType != ""0""),
Locations = make_set(Location),
IPs = make_set(IPAddress)
by UserPrincipalName
| extend RiskScore = (UniqueIPs * 2) + (UniqueLocations * 3) + (FailedSignIns * 5)"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
7	Review Investigation Data	If no critical applications close the incident as false positive	"AuditLogs | where OperationName == ""Add member to role"" | extend RoleName = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties)
IdentityInfo | where TargetDeviceID == ""<DEVICE_ID>"" | where SecurityLevel == ""User""
This KQL query will help identify any data from the tables that might indicate a passwordless authentication issue."			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
8	Review Investigation Data	If any critical application found consider as True Positive	"SigninLogs | where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>"" | extend TimeGenerated = now(), IPAddress = ""<IP_ADDRESS>"", DeviceID = <DEVICE_ID>
AuditLogs | where OperationName == ""Add member to role"" | extend RoleName = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties.RoleName)
IdentityInfo | where UserName == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
SecurityIncident | where IncidentType == ""User Login Failure"" and Status == ""Success"""			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
9	Validate MFA Status	Ensure that the passwordless authentication method used is legitimate (e.g., biometrics, hardware tokens).If there is critical applications without password then reach out IT team to set password by enabling MFA	"SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
| where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>)
| extend Location = strcat(LocationDetails.city, "", "", LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend DeviceName = tostring(DeviceDetail.displayName)
| extend DeviceCompliant = tostring(DeviceDetail.isCompliant)
| extend MFAResult = tostring(AuthenticationDetails[0].succeeded)
| summarize
SignInCount = count(),
UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress),
UniqueLocations = dcount(Location),
FailedSignIns = countif(ResultType != ""0""),
Locations = make_set(Location),
IPs = make_set(IPAddress)
by UserPrincipalName
| extend RiskScore = (UniqueIPs * 2) + (UniqueLocations * 3) + (FailedSignIns * 5)"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
10	Review Authentication Activity	If the authentication is Legitimate then consider it as False Positive and close the incident	"SigninLogs
| where UserPrincipalName == ""<USER_EMAIL>""
| where TimeGenerated > ago(<TIMESPAN>)
| extend Location = strcat(LocationDetails.city, "", "", LocationDetails.countryOrRegion)
| extend DeviceName = tostring(DeviceDetail.displayName)
| extend DeviceCompliant = tostring(DeviceDetail.isCompliant)
| extend MFAResult = tostring(AuthenticationDetails[0].succeeded)
| summarize
SignInCount = count(),
UniqueIPs = dcount(IPAddress),
UniqueLocations = dcount(Location),
FailedSignIns = countif(ResultType != ""0""),
Locations = make_set(Location),
IPs = make_set(IPAddress)
by UserPrincipalName
| extend RiskScore = (UniqueIPs * 2) + (UniqueLocations * 3) + (FailedSignIns * 5)"			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
11	Execute User Identity Information	If unauthorized, take appropriate action such as locking accounts, resetting passwords, or investigating further.	"SigninLogs | where <USER_EMAIL> and <IP_ADDRESS> and <TIMESPAN> | extend timeGenerated = TimeGenerated, deviceId = TargetResources[0].DeviceId, passwordlessAuthentications = true;
This query will identify user accounts with a specified IP address and time range, and will track if they are using passwordless authentication. It extends the `TimeGenerated` and `deviceId` fields for each record to provide additional information about the session details.
### Example Usage:
- SigninLogs | where <USER_EMAIL> and <IP_ADDRESS> and <TIMESPAN> | extend timeGenerated = TimeGenerated, deviceId = TargetResources[0].DeviceId, passwordlessAuthentications = true
This query will automatically update the `timeGenerated` field with the current timestamp, add a new `deviceId` field containing the device ID from the `TargetResources` table, and set `passwordlessAuthentications` to `true`."			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]
12	Review Investigation Data	Enhance monitoring to detect similar events in the future	"Great! I'll now generate an accurate Microsoft Sentinel KQL query for this investigation step.
The task requires enhancing monitoring to detect similar events in the future, focusing on security investigation data using table names: SigninLogs, AuditLogs, IdentityInfo, ThreatIntelligenceIndicator, SecurityIncident, and DeviceInfo.
Given that placeholders are needed but not explicitly provided, I'll create a query for each of these tables:
1. **SigninLogs**:
- Where `UserPrincipalName` == ""<USER_EMAIL>"" and `TimeGenerated` > ago(<TIMESPAN)>
2. **AuditLogs**:
- Join the tables on `UserPrincipalName`, filter by time generated, order by event count in descending order, and sum total number of events.
3. **IdentityInfo**:
- Join the table with `DeviceID` to get `RoleName`. Sum total number of roles associated with devices.
4. **ThreatIntelligenceIndicator**:
- Filter out rows where `TimeGenerated` is less than ago(<TIMESPAN)> and project events count.
5. **SecurityIncident**:
- Join the table on `UserPrincipalName`, filter by time generated, order by incident ID in descending order, and sum total number of incidents.
6. **DeviceInfo**:
- Join the tables on `DeviceID` to get `modifiedProperties`. Sum total number of modified properties per device.
I'll write these queries in KQL syntax with proper operators like where, extend, project, summarize, join to achieve the desired outcome."			[Historical: 100.0% FP rate - typically benign]

You're almost there with the output just some updations required this is the existing template for the reference 
1. Steps are not relevent and getting repeated 
2. Take steps from the template if you want not directly but just take learning from this 
3. KQL Queries are not clean make it clean it is good that providing in each step keep it like that
4. If you wnat you can add explaination of the kql query beside in another column but don't add in that existing thing

Give me the sections to update and avoid hardcoding
