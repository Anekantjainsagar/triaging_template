TECHNICAL OVERVIEW This alert detects unusual or potentially malicious login attempts to user accounts. It leverages behavioral analytics, IP reputation, and impossible travel detection to identify deviations from normal user access patterns. Normal behavior includes logins from known devices and locations; suspicious activity involves logins from new geographic regions, unfamiliar devices, rapid failed attempts, or known malicious IPs.

MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES

T1078 - Valid Accounts
Overview: Adversaries obtain and use legitimate credentials to access systems, bypassing traditional perimeter defenses.
Relevance: Suspicious sign-ins often indicate an adversary attempting to use or having successfully used compromised credentials.
Key Indicators: Successful logins from unusual IPs/locations, new devices, or after multiple failed attempts from different sources.
T1110 - Brute Force
Overview: Adversaries attempt to guess credentials by systematically trying many combinations, often against multiple accounts or services.
Relevance: Many suspicious sign-in alerts are triggered by brute force attacks, credential stuffing, or password spraying attempts against user accounts.
Key Indicators: High volume of failed login attempts against a single account or multiple accounts from a single source IP within a short timeframe.
T1133 - External Remote Services
Overview: Adversaries access an organization's systems or network via external-facing services (e.g., VPN, OWA, RDP) using stolen or brute-forced credentials.
Relevance: Suspicious sign-ins directly relate to adversaries attempting to gain initial access or persistence through these exposed services.
Key Indicators: Login attempts to external services from suspicious geographical locations, known TOR/VPN exit nodes, or IPs with poor reputation.
THREAT ACTORS

Fancy Bear (APT28)
Profile: Russian state-sponsored threat actor, active since at least 2004, known for targeting government, defense, political, and media organizations.
TTPs: Spear-phishing with malicious links/attachments for credential harvesting, brute-forcing accounts, and exploiting known vulnerabilities for initial access.
Notable Attack: 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, which involved extensive spear-phishing and credential theft.
Relevance: Frequently uses suspicious sign-in methods (credential harvesting, brute force) as an initial access vector.
Lapsus$
Profile: Financially motivated extortion group, active since at least late 2021, known for high-profile breaches against technology companies.
TTPs: Social engineering (e.g., calling help desks), SIM swapping, MFA bypass techniques, and purchasing stolen credentials to gain initial access.
Notable Attack: Breaches against Okta, Microsoft, Samsung, Nvidia, where they gained access by targeting and compromising employee accounts.
Relevance: Directly leverages suspicious sign-ins and compromised credentials, often via social engineering, to achieve initial network access.
Scattered Spider (UNC3944)
Profile: Financially motivated threat group, primarily English-speaking, known for targeting organizations in various sectors, including telecommunications and gaming.
TTPs: Extensive use of social engineering, SIM swapping, MFA fatigue attacks, and credential phishing to gain access to corporate networks.
Notable Attack: Recent attacks against MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, involving social engineering to bypass security and gain initial access to IT systems.
Relevance: Their primary method of initial access involves compromising user accounts through tactics that would generate suspicious sign-in alerts.
BUSINESS IMPACT

Data at Risk: User credentials, intellectual property, sensitive customer data, financial records, and internal communications.
Compliance implications: Potential violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA) and industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS, SOX) due to unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
Reputation Impact: Significant loss of customer trust, negative media coverage, brand damage, and potential legal action from affected parties.
Risk Level: HIGH
Rationale: Suspicious sign-ins are often the initial step in a larger attack chain, leading to full account compromise, lateral movement, data exfiltration, or ransomware deployment. Unaddressed, this alert can quickly escalate to a major breach with critical business consequences.


this alert analysis phase is working fine now I want to generate triaging steps on the basis of this thing so you have to use the alert analysis data very wisely to identify and create the steps one thing I'll suggest you can add ip reputation check, email check steps in every manual thing because that is the best thing you can do other steps you decide from teh data with the kql query only for email and ip check no kql needed
