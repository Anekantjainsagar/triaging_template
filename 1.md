This alert detects unusual or potentially malicious login attempts to user accounts. It leverages behavioral analytics, IP reputation, and impossible travel detection to identify deviations from normal user access patterns. Normal behavior includes logins from known devices and locations; suspicious activity involves logins from new geographic regions, unfamiliar devices, rapid failed attempts, or known malicious IPs.


this alert analysis phase is working fine now I want to generate triaging steps on the basis of this thing so you have to use the alert analysis data very wisely to identify and create the steps one thing I'll suggest you can add ip reputation check, email check steps in every manual thing because that is the best thing you can do other steps you decide from teh data with the kql query only for email and ip check no kql needed
