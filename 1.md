📖 Attack Chain Narrative
Timeline of Events
🟠 Stage 1: Initial Access ⏰ 2025-10-06T03:14:42.3501503Z Technique: Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004) Description: Initial successful login to urvashi.upadhyay@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com from Gautampura, IN.
🟠 Stage 1: Initial Access ⏰ 2025-10-06T07:21:50.5830477Z Technique: Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004) Description: Successful login to urvashi.upadhyay@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com from Ahmedabad, IN.
🟠 Stage 1: Credential Access ⏰ 2025-10-22T09:53:30.4563106Z Technique: Brute Force: Password Spraying (T1110.003) Description: Multiple failed login attempts for sweta.tiwari@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com before eventual successful logins or persistent failures from Chiraiyakot, IN
Detailed Narrative
The attack began with potential credential harvesting or theft from various sources, as evidenced by multiple users experiencing failed login attempts followed by successful logins from different geographic locations. This indicates potential password spraying or credential stuffing attacks. Sweta Tiwari's account shows signs of suspicious activity, including multiple failed logins and access from diverse locations within India, warranting closer inspection. Umapreethi V's account showed login failures from one IP. Chirag Gupta and Ganesh Tanneru's accounts also experienced failures due to invalid passwords, pointing towards possible account compromise attempts. Urvashi Upadhyay's account further strengthens the likelihood of account compromise due to failed logins and access from suspicious locations such as Indore using a Medium risk IP, further suggesting the potential use of stolen credentials. The attacker appears to be targeting multiple accounts simultaneously, attempting to gain access to sensitive information or resources within the organization. The impact includes potential data breaches, unauthorized access to critical systems, and financial losses.
🎯 Detailed Technique Analysis
🔴 Confirmed Technique #1
Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)
Tactic: Initial Access (TA0001)
Sub-Technique: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)
The successful logins from multiple locations by the user within a short timeframe points towards a potential account compromise and the attacker using the cloud account to access resources.
Confidence
95%
Timestamp: 2025-10-06T03:14:42.3501503Z
Evidence: Successful logins by __urvashi.upadhyay@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__ from multiple, geographically distant locations within short timeframes (Ahmedabad, Azad Nagar, Mumbai, Indore, Dombivli, New Delhi, Navi Mumbai, Gautampura, Kishanpura). Also, successful logins by __sweta.tiwari@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__ from locations such as Gorakhpur, Allahabad, Mehnajpur, Pune, Bojha, Varanasi, Kalpi, Mahul and Sadat.
Indicators: Impossible travel, Multiple locations in short time, Successful logins after failed attempts
🔧 Procedure (TTP Details): The attacker likely obtained valid credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means. They then used these credentials to successfully log in to the victim's cloud account from multiple locations within short timeframes, indicative of impossible travel. Specifically, the user Urvashi Upadhyay logged in from Gautampura at 2025-10-06T03:14:42.3501503Z and then from Ahmedabad at 2025-10-06T07:21:50.5830477Z. The rapid change in location and multiple successful logins suggests a compromised account.
🟠 Likely Technique #2
Technique: Brute Force (T1110)
Tactic: Credential Access (TA0006)
Sub-Technique: Password Spraying (T1110.003)
The presence of multiple failed logins followed by eventual successful logins suggests that the attacker is attempting to gain access by trying different passwords against multiple accounts.
Confidence
80%
Timestamp: 2025-10-22T09:53:30.4563106Z
Evidence: Multiple failed login attempts for __sweta.tiwari@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__, __chirag.gupta@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__, __ganesh.tanneru@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__, __umapreethi.v@yash.com__ and __urvashi.upadhyay@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__ before eventual successful logins or persistent failures.
Indicators: Multiple failed logins, Account lockout attempts, Standard failure patterns
🔧 Procedure (TTP Details): The attacker is likely using a list of common passwords and trying them against multiple user accounts within the organization. The multiple failed login attempts followed by eventual successful logins point towards the attacker using password spraying techniques to compromise accounts.
🟢 Predicted Technique #3
Technique: Account Discovery (T1087)
Tactic: Discovery (TA0007)
Sub-Technique: Cloud Account (T1087.004)
The access to __urvashi.upadhyay@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__ and __sweta.tiwari@yashtechnologies841.onmicrosoft.com__ is indicative of attacker attempting to identify cloud resources to pivot and explore further.
Confidence
60%
Timestamp: 2025-10-06T07:21:50.5830477Z
Evidence: Successful login to Urvashi's account indicates potential access to cloud resources.
Indicators: Successful Cloud account logins, Access from a new device, Geo-location anomaly, Network service discovery
🔧 Procedure (TTP Details): After gaining initial access, the attacker might explore the compromised account to discover what cloud resources the user has access to. The attacker could use commands or tools to list the cloud resources and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
🔮 Predicted Next Attacker Moves
💡 These techniques have been added to the matrix visualization above in BLUE color
🚨 High Likelihood - Sequence 1
Tactic: Discovery
Technique: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)
Description: The attacker will likely attempt to discover sensitive files and directories within the compromised accounts' access scope.
Rationale: After gaining initial access through valid accounts, attackers typically search for sensitive data, configuration files, or other valuable information that can be used for further exploitation or exfiltration.
Indicators to Watch: Access to unusual file paths, Large-scale file access, Unusual file downloads
Preventive Action: Implement strict access controls and monitor file access patterns.
⚠️ Medium Likelihood - Sequence 2
Tactic: Lateral Movement
Technique: Valid Accounts (T1078)
Sub-Technique: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)
Description: The attacker may attempt to use the compromised account to access other cloud accounts or resources within the organization.
Rationale: Attackers often use compromised accounts as a stepping stone to move laterally within the network and access other systems or resources.
Indicators to Watch: Login attempts to other cloud accounts, Access to resources outside of the user's normal scope, New user agent and device attributes
Preventive Action: Implement multi-factor authentication for all cloud accounts and monitor account activity for suspicious behavior.
ℹ️ Low Likelihood - Sequence 3
Tactic: Exfiltration
Technique: Data Staged (T1074)
Sub-Technique: Local Data Staging (T1074.001)
Description: The attacker may stage data locally within the compromised account before exfiltrating it.
Rationale: Attackers often stage data to prepare it for exfiltration and make it easier to transfer.
Indicators to Watch: Creation of large archive files, Unusual file compression activity, Suspicious data transfers
Preventive Action: Monitor for unusual file activity and data staging.
