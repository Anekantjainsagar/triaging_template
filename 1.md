In this when you're learning from this data you're hardcoding the steps but not seeing that some last steps are not for triaging they are for the verification of the data when it will be decided true/false positive don't follow the things just take learnings from that and do one thing to get some understanding about the alert you can use the technical details of this alert analysis just take that part only so it'll be easy for you do decide which step is relevent if you want you can use that and if you need any file that you don't have then ask me about that and give me the updated section/function don't waste the tokens

the idea is it's not about only kql it's about the steps that are relevent for the investigation just keep those things if not contributing anytihng in the investigation why keep that thing here is teh file
