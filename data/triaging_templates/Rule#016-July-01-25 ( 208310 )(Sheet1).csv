,True Positive (TP) Scenarios,"These indicate unauthorized or malicious activity:
Attacker adds a compromised account to a privileged group (e.g., Global Admin, Privileged Role Admin).
Privileged group membership change from an unusual IP or geolocation (e.g., foreign country, TOR node).
Role assignment follows a risky sign-in or suspicious behavior (e.g., impossible travel, unfamiliar device).
Multiple users added to privileged groups in a short time, suggesting lateral movement.
Assignment made by a non-admin user or unknown service principal.
Privileged group assignment to a dormant or disabled account that was just reactivated.",,
,Benign Positive (BP) Scenarios,"These are unusual but legitimate actions:
Temporary elevation via PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for a valid task or project.
Security team adds a user to a privileged group during an incident response or audit.
Admin assigns a role during off-hours due to time zone differences or urgent needs.
Privileged group assignment from a new IP due to remote work or travel.",,
,False Positive (FP) Scenarios,"These are routine operations that trigger alerts unnecessarily:

Admin adds a user to a privileged group as part of onboarding or access management.
Assignment from a known corporate IP or trusted device, but not yet whitelisted.
Bulk role assignments during a migration or reorganization.
Assignment by a known automation account or service principal (e.g., MS Graph API).
Temporary PIM activations that aren’t filtered out in the rule logic.",,
