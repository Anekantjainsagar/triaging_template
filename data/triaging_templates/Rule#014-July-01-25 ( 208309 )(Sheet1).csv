,True Positive (TP) Scenarios,"These indicate malicious or unauthorized role assignments:
Attacker assigns themselves or another compromised account to a privileged role (e.g., Global Admin).
Privileged role assigned outside business hours from an unusual IP or geolocation.
Role assignment follows a successful risky sign-in (e.g., impossible travel or TOR exit node).
Assignment made by an unknown or suspicious app/service principal.
Multiple privileged roles assigned in quick succession—suggesting lateral movement.
Assignment to a dormant or deactivated account suddenly re-enabled.",,
,Benign Positive (BP) Scenarios,"These are unusual but legitimate actions:
Privileged role assigned temporarily via PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for a valid task.
Security team grants temporary access for an urgent incident response.
Admin assigns a role to a new hire during onboarding, but outside normal hours.
Role assignment from a new IP due to remote work or travel.",,
,False Positive (FP) Scenarios,"These are normal operations that trigger alerts unnecessarily:
Admin assigns a role to a user as part of routine access management.
Assignment from a known corporate IP or trusted device, but not yet whitelisted.
Bulk role assignments during a migration or reorganization.
Temporary elevation via PIM that’s not filtered out in the rule logic.",,
