,,,"Rule#280- Detect when One or more Sophos services are missing or not running. - Based on 0 past incidents (0% FP, 0% TP)"
1,Review Incident Details,,"Review incident metadata including user, IP, and timestamp | Expected: Complete incident overview with key entities identified."
2,Check Threat Intelligence,,"Query threat intelligence sources for IP reputation and known malicious indicators | Expected: Typically shows: Clean IP, No threats. If found → False Positive."
3,Review User Activity,,"Check user sign-in history and behavior patterns | Expected: Typically shows: Known devices, Normal patterns. If found → False Positive."
4,Verify MFA Status,,Confirm multi-factor authentication completion | Expected: Typically shows: MFA successful. If found → False Positive.
5,Final Classification,,"Classify as True Positive, False Positive, or Benign Positive based on all evidence | Expected: Final determination with supporting evidence."
6,Final Classification,,"Classify as True Positive, False Positive, or Benign Positive based on all investigation findings. [HISTORICAL BASELINE] 0% FP, 0% TP from 0 past incidents"
7,Confidence Level,,"Assess confidence: High (strong evidence from multiple sources), Medium (moderate evidence with some gaps), Low (limited or conflicting evidence)"
8,Detailed Justification,,Provide comprehensive reasoning for classification. Reference specific findings from investigation steps above with step numbers and exact evidence
9,Actions Taken,,"Document all investigative actions: KQL queries executed, logs reviewed, threat intelligence checks performed, users/teams contacted, timeline of activities"
10,Escalation Required?,,"Yes/No - If yes, specify escalation path: L3 SOC (confirmed threats), IT Team (system issues), Security Manager (VIP/critical assets), Incident Response Team (active compromise)"

,HISTORICAL REFERENCE DATA,,Statistical analysis from past incidents - use to inform investigation approach
,Total Past Incidents,0,Complete dataset of 0 historical incidents for pattern analysis
,False Positive Rate,0%,"0 of 1 incidents were False Positives. If similar patterns found, likelihood of FP is 0%"
,True Positive Rate,0%,"0 of 1 incidents were True Positives. If threat indicators found, likelihood of TP is 0%"
