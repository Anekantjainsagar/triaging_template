,HISTORICAL REFERENCE DATA,,Statistical analysis from past incidents - use to inform investigation approach
,Total Past Incidents,62,Complete dataset of 62 historical incidents for pattern analysis
,False Positive Rate,100.0%,"62 of 62 incidents were False Positives. If similar patterns found, likelihood of FP is 100.0%"
,True Positive Rate,0.0%,"0 of 62 incidents were True Positives. If threat indicators found, likelihood of TP is 0.0%"
