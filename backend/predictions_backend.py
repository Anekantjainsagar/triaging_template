    # YOUR MISSION: MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING & ATTACK CHAIN RECONSTRUCTION

    You must provide a comprehensive MITRE ATT&CK analysis including:

    1. **Complete Attack Chain Mapping** - Map observed TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK framework
    2. **Attack Progression Timeline** - Reconstruct the attack sequence
    3. **Threat Actor Profiling** - Identify likely threat actor characteristics
    4. **Predicted Next Steps** - Forecast attacker's probable next moves
    5. **Visual Attack Path** - Color-coded technique mapping (Green/Amber/Red)


    ---

    ## ATTACK TIMELINE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:

    **Create a detailed chronological attack timeline with the following:**

    1. **Chronological Ordering**: Arrange all attack events in time sequence based on actual timestamps from investigation data
    2. **Stage Numbering**: Number each stage sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.) to show attack progression
    3. **Complete Context**: For each timeline entry include:
    - Exact timestamp from investigation data
    - MITRE tactic and technique (with sub-technique)
    - Clear description of what happened in business terms
    - Specific evidence from investigation outputs
    - Severity assessment (RED/AMBER/GREEN)
    - Impact statement explaining the security implications
    - List of indicators observed at that stage

    4. **Narrative Flow**: Timeline should tell a story - connect each stage to show how the attack progressed
    5. **Evidence-Based**: Every timeline entry must reference specific data from investigation steps
    6. **Business Language**: Describe technical events in terms business stakeholders can understand

    **Timeline Entry Format:**
    - Stage 1 at [timestamp]: Initial Access via compromised credentials
    - Stage 2 at [timestamp]: Privilege escalation through role manipulation  
    - Stage 3 at [timestamp]: Reconnaissance of cloud resources
    - Stage 4 at [timestamp]: Lateral movement to sensitive systems
    - Stage 5 at [timestamp]: Data exfiltration or impact activities

    **Example Timeline Entry Structure:**
    Stage 1: Initial cloud account compromise at 2025-10-08 11:54:20
    Tactic: Initial Access
    Technique: Valid Accounts with Cloud Accounts sub-technique (T1078.004)
    Description: Attacker accessed cloud account using stolen credentials from suspicious location
    Evidence: Authentication log showing sign-in from unknown IP address
    Severity: AMBER
    Impact: Attacker gained foothold in cloud environment with user privileges
    Indicators: Impossible travel, unknown device, high-risk geographic region

    ## MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS (All 14):
    1. Reconnaissance (TA0043)
    2. Resource Development (TA0042)
    3. Initial Access (TA0001)
    4. Execution (TA0002)
    5. Persistence (TA0003)
    6. Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
    7. Defense Evasion (TA0005)
    8. Credential Access (TA0006)
    9. Discovery (TA0007)
    10. Lateral Movement (TA0008)
    11. Collection (TA0009)
    12. Command and Control (TA0011)
    13. Exfiltration (TA0010)
    14. Impact (TA0040)

    ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUB-TECHNIQUES:

    **ALWAYS include sub-techniques when mapping MITRE techniques:**
    - Use the complete reference provided above to identify appropriate sub-techniques
    - Every technique that has sub-techniques MUST include at least one relevant sub-technique
    - Sub-technique selection must be evidence-based from investigation data
    - Format: "Technique" > "Sub-technique"
    - Example: "Valid Accounts" > "Cloud Accounts" (T1078.004)

    **DO NOT use generic techniques when specific sub-techniques exist**
    - Wrong: "Valid Accounts (T1078)" without sub-technique
    - Correct: "Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)"

    ---


    ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCEDURES (TTP Details):

    **ALWAYS include detailed procedures for each technique:**
    - The "procedure" field must explain HOW the attacker executed the technique
    - Include specific tools, methods, commands, or techniques used
    - Reference actual evidence from the investigation data
    - Describe the attack flow step-by-step
    - Make it actionable for defenders to understand the attack methodology

    **Procedure Example Format:**
    "The attacker used stolen credentials (username: john.doe@abc.com) to authenticate from IP 203.0.113.45 located in an unknown geographic region. The authentication occurred at 14:34:34, shortly after a Global Administrator role was assigned to the account. The attacker leveraged the cloud account access to bypass traditional perimeter defenses, utilizing valid authentication tokens to avoid detection by signature-based security tools."

    **DO NOT use generic procedures** - Every procedure must be specific to THIS investigation's evidence.

    ---

    ## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

    ### For TRUE POSITIVE Cases:
    - Map ALL observed techniques to MITRE ATT&CK framework WITH sub-techniques
    - Identify the current attack stage
    - Predict 3-5 most likely next attacker moves WITH specific sub-techniques
    - Provide detailed kill chain reconstruction
    - Assign severity colors: RED (confirmed), AMBER (likely), GREEN (possible future)
    - Include specific technique IDs and sub-technique IDs (e.g., T1078.004 - Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts)

    ### For FALSE POSITIVE Cases:
    - Map potential misinterpreted behaviors to MITRE techniques WITH sub-techniques
    - Explain why behaviors appeared suspicious but are benign
    - Provide "what-if" attack scenarios for learning
    - Suggest detection improvements to reduce false positives
    - Color code hypothetical attack paths

    ### For Both Cases:
    - Generate comprehensive attack narrative
    - Include MITRE Navigator layer data with sub-techniques
    - Provide defensive recommendations mapped to MITRE techniques and sub-techniques
    - Identify detection gaps

    # CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

    1. **Evidence-Based**: Every MITRE technique AND sub-technique must be supported by specific evidence from investigation
    2. **NO FABRICATION IN PREDICTIONS**: When predicting next attacker moves:
    - Base predictions ONLY on techniques that logically follow from observed activity
    - DO NOT mention specific cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP, DropBox, etc.) unless investigation data explicitly mentions them
    - DO NOT assume "cloud storage" exists unless investigation shows cloud environment
    - DO NOT predict "exfiltration to cloud storage" unless investigation shows cloud infrastructure
    - ONLY predict generic follow-up actions based on observed patterns
    - Example: If you saw "Global Administrator assigned" → predict "Discovery of resources" NOT "Discovery of AWS S3 buckets"
    3. **Sub-Technique Mandatory**: ALWAYS include sub-techniques when they exist for a technique
    4. **Detailed Procedures**: Every technique must have a comprehensive procedure describing the exact attack method
    5. **Comprehensive Timeline**: Attack timeline must include ALL stages with detailed narratives for each event
    6. **Explanations**: All assessment fields (attack_stage, sophistication, confidence, dwell_time) must include detailed explanations
    7. **Color Coding**: 
    - RED = Confirmed observed technique/sub-technique
    - AMBER = Highly likely technique/sub-technique in progress
    - GREEN = Predicted future technique/sub-technique
    8. **Completeness**: Map ALL relevant MITRE tactics (1-14) with appropriate sub-techniques
    9. **Specificity**: Use exact MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs and sub-technique IDs (e.g., T1078.004)
    10. **Actionability**: Recommendations must be specific, prioritized, and implementable
    11. **Timeline Accuracy**: Correlate MITRE techniques with actual timestamps from investigation
    12. **Prediction Quality**: Next steps must include specific sub-techniques and be realistic based on observed attacker behavior
    13. **Geographic Context**: If high-risk countries detected, emphasize in threat profiling
    14. **Sub-Technique Justification**: Explain WHY each specific sub-technique was selected based on evidence
    15. **Navigator Compatibility**: Include both parent techniques and sub-techniques in MITRE Navigator layer
    16. **Coverage Tracking**: Track sub-technique coverage percentage in analysis

    **Sub-Technique Selection Rules**:
    - If evidence shows "cloud account" access → Use T1078.004 (Cloud Accounts)
    - If evidence shows "domain account" access → Use T1078.002 (Domain Accounts)
    - If evidence shows "local account" access → Use T1078.003 (Local Accounts)
    - Always match the most specific sub-technique to the evidence
    - If multiple sub-techniques apply, include all relevant ones

    **Geographic Risk Enhancement**: If investigation involves Russia, China, or other high-risk countries, automatically increase threat severity and include nation-state TTPs with specific sub-techniques in analysis.

    # INVESTIGATION DATA FOR USER: {username}

    {investigation_context}

    # ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

    1. **Classification**: Classify as TRUE POSITIVE or FALSE POSITIVE
    2. **Risk Level**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
    3. **Confidence Score**: 0-100% based on evidence quality
    4. **Key Findings**: List specific suspicious indicators
    5. **Risk Indicators**: Technical risk factors observed

    # CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

    **TRUE POSITIVE Indicators (Prioritize these):**
    - ✅ **ANY IP flagged as malicious by VirusTotal** (even 1/95 detection is SIGNIFICANT)
    - ✅ Access from unknown locations or devices
    - ✅ Impossible travel patterns (multiple countries in short time)
    - ✅ Suspicious IP addresses or high-risk geolocations
    - ✅ Privilege escalation attempts
    - ✅ Unusual account activity patterns
    - ✅ High-risk country connections (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Switzerland)
    - ✅ Multiple failed login attempts followed by success
    - ✅ VIP user with suspicious activity
    - ✅ Analyst remarks indicating suspicion

    **CRITICAL: VirusTotal Detection Rules**
    - `Malicious: 1/95` or higher → **STRONG TRUE POSITIVE indicator**
    - `Malicious: 0/95` → Consider other factors
    - Even 1 out of 95 detections means the IP has been associated with malicious activity
    - Do NOT ignore VirusTotal detections - they are authoritative threat intelligence

    **FALSE POSITIVE Indicators:**
    - All indicators show normal business activity
    - Expected user behavior patterns (same location, same device, business hours)
    - No suspicious technical indicators
    - Legitimate business travel with proper context
    - Authorized administrative actions with justification
    - **VirusTotal shows 0/95 malicious AND no other suspicious indicators**

    # CRITICAL DECISION RULES:

    1. **If VirusTotal shows ANY malicious detection (1/95 or higher)** → Classify as TRUE POSITIVE
    2. **If impossible travel detected** (e.g., USA → Canada → Switzerland in 5 days) → TRUE POSITIVE
    3. **If VIP user + suspicious indicators** → Increase severity to High/Critical
    4. **Multiple risk factors** → TRUE POSITIVE
    5. **High-risk countries** → Increase suspicion significantly
    6. **Do NOT classify as FALSE POSITIVE if VirusTotal detected malicious IP**

    # OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):

    {{
        "classification": "TRUE POSITIVE" or "FALSE POSITIVE",
        "risk_level": "Critical" or "High" or "Medium" or "Low",
        "confidence_score": 85,
        "key_findings": [

                "evidence": "Supporting evidence"
            }}
        ]
    }}

    **IMPORTANT:** 
    - Base classification on ACTUAL evidence, not assumptions
    - If VirusTotal flagged an IP as malicious (even 1/95), that alone is sufficient for TRUE POSITIVE
    - Impossible travel across multiple countries in short time = TRUE POSITIVE
    - VIP user compromise = Higher severity
