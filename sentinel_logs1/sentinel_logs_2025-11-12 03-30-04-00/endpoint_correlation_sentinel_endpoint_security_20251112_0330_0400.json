These events triggered a disproportionately high number of 8 security alerts. This suggests potentially significant or anomalous file-related activity on the system requiring immediate attention and further investigation.",

      "description": "Multiple file deletion events have been observed on the `wazuh1` device, initiated by the `wazuh-indexer` service account and the `java` process. The deleted files, such as `_jw_Lucene912_0.doc`, are located within the `/var/lib/wazuh-indexer/nodes/0/indices/` directory, which are typical paths for OpenSearch (Wazuh Indexer's underlying technology) Lucene index segment files.
