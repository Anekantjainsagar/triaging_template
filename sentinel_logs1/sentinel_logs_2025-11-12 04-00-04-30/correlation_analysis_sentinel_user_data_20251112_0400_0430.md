## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav (2 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Raviraj, successfully accessed two of our applications, which is unusual for a guest account. This is concerning because it involved cross-tenant access and relied on single-factor authentication, which presents a higher security risk for our data.

---

**2. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Rohan Karekar (1 events)**

We detected that a guest user, Rohan Karekar, successfully accessed one of our applications from an external organization. This is concerning because their access only required a single password, which is less secure than our standard multi-step login and could make our systems vulnerable if that password were compromised.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Suspicious Rapid Activity - dewansh singh (8 events)**

We've detected unusual activity on Dewansh Singh's account, where it successfully accessed four different applications from two unique locations in just over a minute. This rapid, successful access from multiple locations is highly unusual and could indicate unauthorized access or a compromised account, which we need to investigate immediately to ensure our systems remain secure.

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Uday  Sharma (1 events)**

We've identified an unusual event where a guest user, Uday Sharma, successfully accessed resources in a different tenant than their assigned one. This is concerning because it highlights a potential misconfiguration that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems across our various environments.
