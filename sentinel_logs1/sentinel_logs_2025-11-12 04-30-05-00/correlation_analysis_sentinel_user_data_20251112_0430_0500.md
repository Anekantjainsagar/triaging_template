## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav (2 events)**

We've detected that Raviraj, a guest user, successfully accessed one of our applications from two different geographic locations in a short timeframe. This is concerning because guest users accessing our systems from multiple locations, especially when relying on single-factor authentication, significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access or account compromise.

---

**2. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Weak Authentication Methods - Athrva Tomar (1 events)**

While Athrva Tomar's account successfully accessed an application, we've flagged a concern because it primarily relies on just a password for authentication. This makes the account significantly more vulnerable to unauthorized access if that password were ever compromised, even though no actual breach has occurred.
