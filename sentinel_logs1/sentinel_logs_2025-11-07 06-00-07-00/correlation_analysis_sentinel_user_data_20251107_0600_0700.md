## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)**

We've detected unusual activity where Lalit Paliwal, a guest user, experienced a critical authentication failure while trying to access our systems. This is concerning because it involved a guest user attempting cross-tenant access, and critical failures like this can sometimes indicate unauthorized access attempts or significant misconfigurations that require immediate investigation.

---

**2. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Critical Authentication Failures - Pooja Gupta (2 failures/2 events)**

We observed two unsuccessful attempts by an unknown user, Pooja Gupta, to log into one of our applications. This is concerning because these repeated failures suggest an unauthorized individual tried to access our systems without a valid account, which could indicate a probing attempt.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Geographically Distributed Access & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Prabhat Sutar (4 events)**

We've detected unusual activity from guest user Prabhat Sutar, who accessed our systems from three different geographic locations within a short period. This pattern is concerning because it could indicate a compromised account or unauthorized credential sharing, which poses a potential security risk to our data.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav (2 events)**

We've observed that Raviraj, a guest user, successfully accessed two of our applications. This activity is concerning because guest users accessing across different parts of our system, especially when protected only by a single password, increases our risk if their account were ever compromised.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Rohan Karekar (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Rohan Karekar, successfully accessed one of our applications. This is concerning because the access involved a guest user reaching across different areas of our network and was only protected by a single password, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if that password were to be compromised.

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Risk Score 7-10



## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Risk Score 5-6


### 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)

**Alert Summary:** Success rate: 50.0%

**📝 Description:** _We've detected a critical authentication failure involving a guest user, Lalit Paliwal, attempting to access an application. This is concerning because it highlights a guest account with predominantly single-factor authentication attempting cross-tenant access, which significantly increases our security risk._

**Risk Factors:** Critical authentication failures: 1, Predominantly single-factor authentication, Guest user cross-tenant access

**Behavioral Anomalies:** Critical authentication failures: 1
