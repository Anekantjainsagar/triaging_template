## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)**

We detected unusual activity where Lalit, a guest user, experienced a critical authentication failure while attempting to access an application. This is concerning because it involved a guest user potentially trying to access resources across different parts of our system, and our reliance on single-factor authentication for guests increases the risk of unauthorized access.

---

**2. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Critical Authentication Failures - Pooja Gupta (2 failures/2 events)**

We've detected two critical failed login attempts from an unrecognized user, Pooja Gupta, trying to access one of our applications. This is concerning because repeated attempts to access our systems with an invalid account could indicate someone is attempting unauthorized access.

---

**3. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Geographically Distributed Access & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Prabhat Sutar (4 events)**

We've detected unusual activity where Prabhat Sutar, a guest user, accessed our systems from three different geographic locations. This is concerning because such geographically diverse access for a single guest account could indicate a potential account compromise or unauthorized use.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Raviraj Ramesh Jadhav (2 events)**

We detected that a guest user, Raviraj, successfully accessed two of our applications. This is concerning because it involved a guest user accessing resources across different parts of our system, and this access was primarily secured by only a single password, which is a less robust security measure.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Rohan Karekar (1 events)**

We've identified that a guest user, Rohan Karekar, successfully accessed resources across different parts of our network. This cross-tenant access by a guest is unusual and concerning because it could potentially expose sensitive information, especially since their account relies on single-factor authentication.

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Risk Score 7-10



## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Risk Score 5-6


### 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Critical Authentication Failures & Cross-Tenant Guest Activity - Lalit Paliwal (1 failures/2 events)

**Alert Summary:** Success rate: 50.0%

**📝 Description:** _We've detected unusual activity where Lalit Paliwal, a guest user, experienced a critical authentication failure while trying to access our systems. This is concerning because it involved a guest user attempting to access resources they shouldn't have, which, coupled with the critical failure, suggests a potential unauthorized access attempt or a significant security misconfiguration._

**Risk Factors:** Critical authentication failures: 1, Predominantly single-factor authentication, Guest user cross-tenant access

**Behavioral Anomalies:** Critical authentication failures: 1
