## 🚨 TOP SECURITY ALERTS


**1. 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Suspicious Rapid Activity - Chandrakant Vishwakarma (1 failures/12 events)**

We've observed unusual, very rapid activity from Chandrakant Vishwakarma's account, where they quickly accessed five different applications and had multiple distinct sessions in a very short period. This highly unusual speed and clustered behavior, along with a failed attempt to bypass strong authentication, is concerning as it could indicate a compromised account or an automated attack trying to gain unauthorized access.

---

**2. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Critical Authentication Failures - Aarushi Trivedi (1 failures/1 events)**

We detected a critical login failure for Aarushi Trivedi, where her attempt to access an application was immediately blocked by our security system. This is concerning because such critical failures can indicate either a legitimate user having trouble accessing their account or a potential unauthorized attempt to gain access.

---

**3. 🚨 [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - 451fa0fb-e092-49d6-8d49-4f0e63f88458 (1 failures/1 events)**

We detected a guest user attempting to access one of our applications, but their access was blocked because they didn't use strong authentication. This is concerning as it shows a guest user trying to access resources across different organizational boundaries without proper security, which could expose us to risk if successful.

---

**4. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Swaraj Arvind Sontakke (1 events)**

We detected a guest user, Swaraj Sontakke, successfully accessing our systems from an external tenant. This is concerning because the access relied only on a single password, which makes it less secure and increases the risk of unauthorized access if that password were ever compromised.

---

**5. ⚠️ [LOW RISK] Cross-Tenant Guest Activity & Weak Authentication Methods - Aarushi  Trivedi (1 events)**

We've identified a guest user, Aarushi Trivedi, successfully accessing our systems from an external company's environment. This cross-tenant access is concerning because it involves an external user accessing our resources, and it was completed using only single-factor authentication, which is a less secure method.

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - Risk Score 7-10



## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Risk Score 5-6


### 🚨 [MEDIUM RISK] Suspicious Rapid Activity - Chandrakant Vishwakarma (1 failures/12 events)

**Alert Summary:** Success rate: 91.67% | 5 applications | 5 activity sessions

**📝 Description:** _We've detected unusual, rapid activity from Chandrakant Vishwakarma's account, with multiple attempts to access different applications in a very short timeframe, including one failed login. This quick burst of activity, especially with a failure, is concerning as it could signal an unauthorized user trying to gain access or test credentials._

**Risk Factors:** Multiple activity clusters: 5, Rapid event cluster: 6 events in 36s

**Behavioral Anomalies:** Multiple distinct activity sessions: 5 clusters
